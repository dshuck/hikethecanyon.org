Like most fertility deities, Kokopelli presides over both childbirth and agriculture. He is also a trickster god." /><span style="font-weight:bold;">8:34am</span> - After finishing breakfast and breaking camp, we left the North Rim campsite and left on our �  mile hike to the North Kaibab Trailhead.  After a somewhat chilly night with the lows around 40 degrees, it was good to be moving.  Both of us were comfortable in shorts once we started moving.   The trailhead is just a little further up into Roaring Springs Canyon from the campsite, probably close to a mile north of the Grand Canyon Lodge.

<p /><span style="font-weight:bold;">9:01am</span> - We made a short stop at the trailhead for some park employees to snap our picture at the North Kaibab Trail sign and began our decent into the canyon.  It was almost hard to believe we were actually doing it after such long planning and anticipation.  It was an absolutely beautiful day with cloudless skies and temperatures just perfect for outside activity.  The views dropping in were really stunning.  The first hour or so was a series of switchbacks, and our decent was pretty rapid.  By the end of the day, we dropped from 8200 feet to 4000 feet in about 7.5 miles on the trail.  One thing that I found quite notable about the upper part of the North Kaibab was the absolute silence�rarely even the sound of a bird.  Dad was a few switchbacks below me at one point and we were still talking in a normal speaking voice.  The acoustics were really wild.  We were shouting to hear echoes, and the resonance was amazing.  The sound would loop into a solid sound that held for about 5-7 seconds.  Occasionally you would hear an unexpected echo coming back on top of that after hitting a far wall.  There was a particular section of trail probably about 2-3 hours in that will stick with me forever. The trail hugged the right wall, and in many places was carved out of the solid rock. There was a long drop to the left and the views in front were truly breathtaking.  While hiking, especially on trails along the edge, you really need to watch your feet.  However, you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't stop occasionally to just look around.  It is like no place on earth.

<p />After lunch, the views began to change as we got lower into the canyon.  There weren't as many sheer dropoffs, and the trail took a slightly straighter route.  At some point we began to hear the sound of rushing water.  From viewing the map, we knew we were approaching Roaring Springs.  When we got down to the side trail that led to the springs, we dropped our pack and ventured down.  It was wild how light we felt on our feet after shedding 40 pounds each.  We spent about 30-45 minutes at the falls.  It was a really pretty area with lots of little falls at the base of two larger falls that worked their way down from the top.  There was a restroom here and running water.  Late in the season they cut the running water off on the north side of the canyon.  We knew that if there was water here, we would have it available as we traveled south.

<p />Feeling refreshed from the break, we went back to the main trail and continued our decent down the North Kaibab.  From this point on until we reached the Colorado River, the water from Roaring Springs, which is much of the source of Bright Angel Creek, would be more or less beside us.  The overwhelming silence was replaced by the sound of water rushing over rocks.  Just a short hike down from Roaring Springs, we crossed a bridge.  There was a permanent residence here and a couple was out in their yard enjoying the air.  They actually had a dirt basketball court outside with a basketball lying under the goal.  Our guess is that the residents there operate a pump house on the creek.

<p />After crossing the creek and hiking down the east side of it, things began to seemingly flatten out quite a bit.  We were still going down, just not nearly as quickly.  About a mile or so past the house and bridge, we started wondering if somehow we had missed Cottonwood Campground.   It didn't seem likely but the idea of having to backtrack wasn't sitting well.  We took out the map and felt that we were about 80% sure it was still in front of us.  That was enough for us to move forward.  Within 30-45 minutes we hit the camp.   

<p /><span style="font-weight:bold;">3:03pm</span> - Cottonwood Campground is a simple but well maintained campground with a Ranger residence onsite on the south end.  There were probably about 15-20 camping spots.  The night we stayed only about 3 or 4 other campsites were used.  There was running drinkable water here, nice restrooms and easy access to Bright Angel Creek.  After choosing our spot and dropping gear, Dad and I headed down to the icy water of the creek to soak our feet.  It was almost unbearably cold, but felt so good.

<p />After cooling off the feet, we worked on setting up camp.  Dad cooked up chicken tetrazini and we both had some hot spiced cider.  I let Dad beat me in another game or two of gin and we called it a night.
