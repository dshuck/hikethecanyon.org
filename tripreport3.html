				<span style="font-weight:bold;">8:55am</span> - Wednesday morning we packed up camp and began down the North Kaibab headed south.  There was a sign on the south end of camp that read <em>Ribbon Falls � 1.1</em>.  We planned to drop packs and spend a little time there.  The trail on the way there was much like we had experienced late in the day on Day 1, a very gradual but consistent downhill with a few P.U.D.s (Dad's term for Pointless Ups and Downs).  There were nice broad views of the east and west walls or Bright Angel Canyon as the trail headed down the center of the canyon.

<p/>We reached Ribbon Falls and dropped our packs heading down the side trail about 10 minutes off the west side of the main trail.  There is a bridge over Bright Angel Creek and the side canyon that Ribbon Falls is tucked away into is back to the right, out of sight of the main trail.  Ribbon Falls is a really powerful experience.  You are tucked away into a remote part of the canyon and there is some fantastic beauty and solitude.  On the east wall about 100 feet from the falls there is an alcove that you can climb up to.  It had a constant drip of water inside it as well, and subsequently there were several interesting cave-like structures (stalagmites and stalactites) that have grown over the years.  After checking out the alcove, we headed up to the top of the falls.  The big 50' base of Ribbon Falls is a stalagmite also very similar to what is found in caves.  It has been created by mineral deposits in the water.  Dad said that the hole towards the bottom was notably smaller than when he was there last.  If that is so, it makes me wonder how it will look when I am there next.  Standing at the top of the falls offered a nice view back south.  The spray of the water was refreshing and the steady sounds of the water filled the air.  We stayed at Ribbon Falls for the better part of an hour, the trekked back to the main trail, put the packs back on, and continued south on the North Kaibab.

<p/>As we ventured further south the canyon began to change a bit.  Rather than the wide views with more rolling walls, the walls began to get tighter, still following along Bright Angel Creek.  The last 2-3 miles was all very similar in that regard.  In many places the trail had been blasted out of the side of the rock.  The canyon offers so many different views on the way down.  One of my big misconceptions before the hike was that after dropping in the rim it would all be very similar.  Not so.  The Grand Canyon is made up of at least 600 major canyons and 1000s of minor canyons. The variety and constant changes in the terrain and vegetation is interesting.

<p/><span style="font-weight:bold;">3:15pm</span> - We arrived at Phantom Ranch.  I was surprised by how nice it is.  There are dozens of really cool little cabins that are rented my the mulers.  There are a number of structures including a restaurant, bar (open 8-10pm), and if I am not mistaken some kind of little trading post.  We were surprised to find a pay phone on the way through.  We noted that we would have to come back for some calls home that night. 

<p/>We worked our way down to Bright Angel Campground where we would be camping.  It lies about � mile south of the main buildings of Phantom Ranch.  Bright Angel Campground was far more crowded that Cottonwood.  Many more people hike down from the South Rim to Phantom Ranch and back than do the rim to rim hike.  That combined with scores of mulers make this a pretty happening spot.  Once again, the camping was top notch, with nice clean bathrooms, running water, and a really well maintained area.  Once we picked our spot (#27), just dropped our stuff and walked down to the Colorado River.  After 15 miles we were finally at the mighty Colorado.  We walked upstream (east) towards the older Black Bridge.  We cooled our feet in the river at the raft beach for a few minutes and took in the sites.  I was really surprised at how fast the river flows.  It is nice and smooth at that point, but even with no rapids you can see how quickly it is moving.  At over 400 feet across that is a heck of a lot of water rolling by.  After a bit we re-booted, and walked back up the the trail to the bridge.  On the left there is some kind of grave against the wall.  As of the time of this writing I am still trying to determine who it is.  On the right before the bridge, we passed an Anasazi Indian pueblo ruin which was occupied between 1050AD and 1150AD. 

<p/>We reached the Black Bridge and headed across its 440 expanse.  It is a fixed suspension bridge meaning that you feel no rocking movement, unlike the newer Silver Bridge.  On the south end there is a tunnel through the rocks.  We passed through the tunnel and found a mother deer and two fawns munching on the scrub brush.  They took notice of us, then just carried on.  We started making less subtle movements to see if they would look at us for a picture but there were pretty indifferent.  Dad made the comment that they obviously had never been shot at by anything other than cameras. 

<p/>We crossed back over the river and setup camp before it got dark.  Around dark, Dad cooked up some beef stroganoff and we both wolfed it down.  After a cup of hot chocolate, we took a short hike up to the main Phantom Ranch area to try the pay phone.  I gave Michelle and the boys a call and they were really surprised to hear from us.  They were expecting us to be out of reach for another couple of days.  

<p/>On our way back to camp, a guy asked us if we knew where the amphitheater was.  Not knowing, it turned out we were standing right next to the entrance.  He told us that the ranger gave a talk at 7:30, and since it was about 7:15 we decided to stay.  Ranger Lori Rome gave a very entertaining talk on mountain lions.  She was a ball of fire and obviously loves her job.  Somehow though I think I would have maybe felt better hearing about the world record 270 lbs mountain lion that was found in the Grand Canyon after the hike!

<p/><a href="http://www.hitthetrail.com/phantom_map.htm" target="_blank">Here is a great area map</a> of the Phantom Ranch/Bright Angel Campground drawn by a man named Sjor that volunteered at the Ranger Station for over 10 years.  It will would definitely give you a feel for what I described above.
