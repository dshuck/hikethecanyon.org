He is also a trickster god." /><em>I have never been the first one to leave a campground, but several times I have been the last</em> <br /> Wayne Shuck, Indian Garden Campground 11-4-05

<p/><span style="font-weight:bold;">9:03am</span> - In our typical fashion, we didn't leave the campground until after 9:00am.  Our philosophy from the beginning had been just to make this hike as enjoyable as possible.  We purposely planned short days so we would have time to play around.  The last day was no exception, especially since we were in no hurry to leave the canyon, and we knew this would be our shortest day.

<p/>We began our hike toward the South Rim.  From Indian Garden, it is a nice steady but easy climb for about 30 minutes or so before you really start traversing up the switchbacks on the wall.  We were both feeling pretty good and made good time.  There were not many notable sights on the way out as basically everything you can see from the South Rim visitor's center, you can see from the Bright Angel Trail on the way up.  Before too long, day hikers began passing us on their way down.  We passed three mule trains also making their way down the switchbacks.

<p/>At about a mile from the top there is a rest area with bathrooms.  There were a number of people around this area, as I suppose this is a common turnaround point for many.  From that point onward, we saw more people wearing tennis shoes than hiking boots. Many of them stopped us and we got to tell about our journey from the North Rim.  I think we convinced many people they have to come back and do it themselves.  As we watched Indian Garden and Plateau Point grow smaller, a kind of unexpected feeling started to hit me.  It was almost a little ache that our journey was nearly behind us.  The entire previous 4 days I was very conscious that the memories we were making will stay with me the rest of my life.  It had been such a wonderful hike, and it was very hard to know that it was going in the history books.   Of course, blended with that was some level of "Man, we did it!".  If you pause to consider what a small percentage of people living in this country do what you did, you realize what a special thing you have done.  As silly as it may sound to someone who haven't been there, my eyes were partially welled up the last ï¿½ mile of the hike.  To those who have, I imagine you understand.

<p/>As we moved toward the top, we began to see more evidence of approaching the real world.  Soon I spotted the American Flag flying high on the South Rim at the edge behind Bright Angel Lodge.  The rim grew closer and closer and Plateau Point began to look like it had when we arrived 5 days before

<p/><span style="font-weight:bold;">12:35pm</span> - When we reached the top, there were a number of tourists standing around.  There were also a number of backpackers who like us were looking back on where they had come from.  It is obvious from watching that people have a hard time just walking away and tossing their gear in the car at the end.  We saw several familiar faces we had passed in the preceding days.  As people who had met were saying goodbyes, a hiker from Chicago made the remark it reminded him of summer camp as a kid saying goodbye to your new buddies. 

<p/>As corny as it may sound, I feel that I have left a little bit of myself in the Grand Canyon, and I know I am truly bound to make this trip again.  As I crossed the Colorado River two days before I told myself "This will not be the last time you do this!".  I hope that like my Dad, I have the opportunity to do this with my boys and that they too can walk away holding such incredible memories and a love for a place like no other on earth.
