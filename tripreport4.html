Like most fertility deities, Kokopelli presides over both childbirth and agriculture. He is also a trickster god." />Thursday Morning we awoke to find that we had some visitors in our campsite overnight.  Dad had told me about ringtailed cats he experienced in the canyon 15 years earlier and how they are bold enough to go through hikers' gear at night.  Wednesday night before going to bed, I took advantage of the running water in the restrooms and  had gone to clean up with my wash cloth/towel.  When I returned I hung my towel on a little chicken wire fence to dry overnight. Before going to bed, we hung our packs from the  metal  T-shaped trees they provide in each campsite for that purpose.  We only slept about 5 feet from them and Dad told me he swore he heard something jumping up and climbing around our packs in the night.  As we got out of our tents I found that the towel I had hang to dry had magically been carried off about 10 feet.  When we went over to our picnic table for breakfast, we found little cat-like paw prints over all of our stuff.  Now I too had experienced the ringtailed cat.
				
<p/><span style="font-weight:bold;">9:43am</span> - We left Bright Angel Camp and began our ascent.  After going down for two days, it was a dramatic change.  I had actually built up the climb in my head as a looming obstacle in front of us, but once we started moving, it was just like anything else.  One foot in front of the other.  We began our morning by crossing the Silver Bridge just slightly downstream from the Black Bridge.  Unlike the Black Bridge, this is not a fixed suspension bridge, meaning that when other people are on it you can feel the movement.  It is a little bit of a strange sensation when you are 40-50' over the cold Colorado River a couple hundred feet from shore... oh yeah, and you can see through the grated floor!  

<p/>After crossing we continued west along the south shoreline.  We climbed up a 100-200 feet only to find that we would actually drop back down close to shore again.  (Another P.U.D.).  A little way up the river the trail took a decidedly south turn and we began our climb up toward Indian Garden.  We stopped for lunch next to a small cave along the trail.  It appears that someone had intentions of mining here.  However, the digging stops dead about 12 feet past the entrance.  

<p/>As we ate our tuna fish pita bread sandwiches, we looked ahead at the trail.  Right after lunch we would start a pretty dramatic climb through the Devil's Corkscrew, which is a very recognizable set of switchbacks east of Indian Garden.

<p/>When we began hiking again, we started into the switchbacks.  About 6 or 7 switchbacks high, we crossed paths with the first mule train we had seen so far on the trail.  I actually enjoyed the climbing in this area.  I found this somehow easier due to the constant short measurable goals; that being the turns at each end.  After a long period of climbing we entered a really cool part of the trail. It is shaded with giant cottonwoods and a creek goes through tumbling through the rock.  We rested a minute here enjoying the scene.  Once we picked back up it seemed like we got to Indian Garden in no time. 

<p/><span style="font-weight:bold;">1:30pm</span> - We reached Indian Garden.  This was yet another very impressive camping area.  The park service does an excellent job maintaining both the trails and the camping areas.  It was top notch from one rim to the other.  We picked out a campsite right next to running drinkable water and the restrooms.   When we got there, Dad wanted to take a quick nap, so I took out my ground cloth and he laid his sleeping bag out and snoozed for about 30 minutes.  I was not that tired and told Dad I was going to just do some writing.  Dad  woke me up about 30 minutes later and I found myself asleep on the bench of the picnic table.  OK, maybe I was a little tired.

<p/>We overheard the Ranger telling another camper that the sun sets at Plateau Point at 4:30.  We definitely wanted to make the 1.5 mile trip out there.  Plateau Point is the most visible trail that visitors to the South Rim see.  You can see it winding out towards the river.  From the top this looks like the bottom of the canyon.  However, what you find when you go out there is a 1500 foot straight down drop to the Colorado River. It is an amazing view and likely the biggest dropoff you will see on your hike.  The rapids on the Colorado River look tiny from there, but you can hear them roaring even that high.  Looking down to the east, we were able to see much of the trail we had taken that day.  We sat out on the point for about an hour, watching the day's falling shadows creep across the canyon walls.  Neither one of us had remembered to bring our lights out with us so we took off as the sun set behind the canyon wall.  On the way back, we were staring straight up the wall we would have to tackle the next day on our way out of the canyon.  Dad counted 14 switchbacks, but we knew dang well there would be many more.

<p/>After the 1.5 mile trek back to camp, we ate some dinner, played a little more gin (my luck had finally turned :)), and hit the sleeping bags.  Tomorrow would be a good climb!
