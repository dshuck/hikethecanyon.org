			<div style="height:400px;overflow:auto;"><img src="/images/kokopelliPara.jpg" border="0" align="left" alt="Kokopelli is a fertility deity, usually depicted as a humpbacked flute player (often with a huge phallus and antenna-like protrusions on his head), who is worshipped by many Native American tribes in the Southwestern United States. Like most fertility deities, Kokopelli presides over both childbirth and agriculture. He is also a trickster god." />On the morning of October 31, 2005, Dad and I took a Trans Canyon Shuttle (phone: 928-638-2820) from the lodge on the South Rim to the campground on the North Rim.  There is only one place for cars to cross the canyon on a new bridge built in 1995 that replaced the Navajo Bridge near Lee's Ferry at the east end of the canyon.  The Original bridge was left standing and is still used for foot traffic today.  The ride to the North Rim was about 4 hours.  We were in no hurry to get there as that was kind of a hurry-up-and-wait day.  We knew that once we were there we were going to be kind of sitting around until we began our hike the next day.  We were warned that since we were going so late in the season, we might not be able to actually get to the North Rim since they stop plowing the roads in mid-October.  We were expecting overnight temperatures in the teens our first night and packed extra heavy clothes for that purpose.  Fortunately, we experienced a rare warm streak, and our overnight lows on the North Rim only hit about 40 degrees.  While this was a nice surprise, we both couldn't help but think about the extra clothes we were unnecessarily carrying!

<p/>If you plan on making this trip in the off-season as we did, it is important to remember <span style="font-weight:bold;">there is no water on the North Rim</span>.  Take plenty with you or you will find yourself in trouble.  We took about 2 gallons in addition to the hydration units in our packs and it was a good thing! 
				
<p />Rather than just sitting around when we got there, we decided to tour a bit.  After setting up camp we took off on the Transept Trail that runs from the edge of the campground about a mile or so along the edge of the canyon until it reaches the Grand Canyon Lodge.  We walked out to Bright Angel Point and spent a while soaking it all in.  I was both nervous and excited about what was in store for us the next day.  The old lodge was closed for the winter, but we were still able to get up on the big porch and try our best to pick out structures on the South Rim where we would eventually finish our trip.  After a brief stop in the North Rim Visitor Center and chatting with the two rangers on duty, we struck out to make sure we would have no problem finding the trailhead in the morning.

<p />After nailing that down, we headed back to camp to warm up with a little coffee and dinner and settle in for the night.  It was a ghost town.  In a park that was normally teeming with visitors in the regular season, there were only sporadic sightings of other people.  I would guess there were no more than 50-100 people on the North Rim while we were there.  While sitting around the table that night we heard two very odd sounds.  Dad described it as a "house-sized rock falling on another rock".  After the first one, we brushed it off thinking it was some other camper or something.  However, when the second one hit, we could both feel it through the picnic table benches.  We both guessed these were small tremors.  After a few cold hands playing Gin, we called it a night.
